# Histopathologic_Cancer_Detection
### 1.1 Data
In this dataset, we are provided with a large number of small pathology images to classify. Files are named with an image id. The train_labels.csv file provides the ground truth for the images in the train folder. We are predicting the labels for the images in the test folder. A positive label indicates that the center 32x32px region of a patch contains at least one pixel of tumor tissue. Tumor tissue in the outer region of the patch does not influence the label. 
The dataset was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection/data
### 1.2 Project Topic
The goal of this project is to identify metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans. To achieve this goal, I will:  
+ Inspect, Visualize and Clean the data.  
+ Build two CNN models.
+ Run hyperparameter tuning, try different architectures for comparison. 
+ Analysis and Result.
+ Conclusion.
